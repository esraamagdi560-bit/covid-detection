## 📋 Overview

This application uses a trained deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into three categories:
- **COVID-19 Positive**: X-rays showing patterns consistent with COVID-19 infection
- **Normal**: Healthy chest X-rays with no signs of infection
- **Viral Pneumonia**: X-rays showing patterns consistent with viral pneumonia

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Accurate Classification**: Deep learning model for X-ray image analysis
- 📊 **Confidence Scores**: Displays prediction confidence percentages
- 🎨 **Professional UI**: Clean, medical-themed interface with color-coded results
- 📈 **Detailed Analysis**: Shows probability distribution across all categories
- ⚡ **Fast Processing**: Optimized model loading with caching
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers
